A Comparative Analysis of Life Tables: Examining Demographic Disparities between Black and White Populations in the USA (2000-2020)

## Executive Summary
Disparities between Black and White populations in the USA are deeply rooted in historical and socioeconomic contexts. This research project conducts a thorough comparative analysis of life tables from 2000 to 2020, confirming persistent demographic disparities between Black and White populations in the United States. Noteworthy findings include distinct mortality trends, a diminishing life expectancy gap, and the impact of the pandemic, particularly on Black males. Age-specific and regional analyses emphasize the need for targeted interventions. The Lee-Carter model indicates positive mortality trends for Black populations, forecasting a gradual reduction in the life expectancy gap, expected to fully close after 2060.

## Purpose and Objective
The purpose of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis of life tables to examine demographic disparities between Black and White populations in the USA from 2000 to 2020.

## Research Question(s):
• How have demographic indicators, as reflected in life tables, evolved differently for Black and White populations in the United States over the period 2000-2020?
• What factors may contribute to any observed disparities?
